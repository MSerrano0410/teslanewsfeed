To run the TeslaNewsFeed.jar file, please run it as such on a command prompt or terminal window:

TeslaNewsFeed.jar [URL], [output directory(optional)].

The URL must be in the http://something.com/arguments.html format; the project includes the following:

- jUnit test cases for sample RSS feed URLs.
- copious comments and descriptions of classes and methods.
- error checking for URLs and formats.

I've also included, along with the .jar file, a .zip folder with some of the source code; the libraries I've used are in the lib folder, while my actual source code is in the src folder.

I've also uploaded this project to my Github account, and am happy to provide the link to that at your request.
